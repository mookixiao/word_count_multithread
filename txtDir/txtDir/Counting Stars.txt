Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars
I see this life
Like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
I, feel something so right
But doing the wrong thing
I, feel something so wrong
But doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be
Baby I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be
Baby I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
I feel the love
And I feel it burn
Down this river every turn
Hope is a four letter word
Make that money
Watch it burn
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
I, feel something so wrong
But doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly
Lately I've been losing sleep
Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be
Baby I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be
Baby I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
Take that money
And watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I learnt
Take that money
And watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I learnt
Take that money
And watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I learnt
Take that money
And watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I learnt
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be
Baby I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Take that money
And watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I learnt
Take that money
And watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I learnt
Take that money
And watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I learnt
Take that money
And watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I learnt
